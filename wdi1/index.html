  <h3><u>The Perfect Doggy Date</u></h3>
  <article>
    <p>Holly's idea of a perfect date includes running around in dirt, chasing birds, and eating plenty of meat. Walking around her home town is one of her favorite daily activities including jumping on her owner. Holly only enjoys looking at water so don't think about taking her for a swim.
     Holly enjoys a good steak over Purina dog food anyday.</p>
